This repository describes the architecture and setup of a server-side rendering (SSR) system for React components using Express.js and Vite, including fetching data needed for rendering (using getStaticProps ) and handling CSS and JavaScript (JS) assets for these components. The system leverages the <esi:include/> tag for dynamic content inclusion, optimizing for performance, maintainability, and scalability.
